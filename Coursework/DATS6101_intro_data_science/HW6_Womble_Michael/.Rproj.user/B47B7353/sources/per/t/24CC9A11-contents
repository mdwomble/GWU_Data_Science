# HW Assignment - Hypothesis Testing 

This exercise uses the same graduate school admissions dataset from last homework. The dataset is LogRegAdmit.csv.  
The variables in the dataset are:  

* `admit`: 0 or 1 (False or True)
* `gre`: gre score
* `gpa`: grade point average at undergraduate level
* `rank`: the ranking of the applicant’s undergraduate institute, 1, 2, 3, or 4


## Grad School Admissions


### Question 1

**Same as last homework, import the dataset as Adata, and make sure the data type for the variables are set properly for categorical variables.**

```{r q01}
Adata <- data.frame(read.csv("LogRegAdmit.csv"))
Adata$admit<-as.factor(Adata$admit)
Adata$rank<-as.factor((Adata$rank))
```

Applicant data is imported as Adata and admit and rank columns are converted from numeric and integer data types, respectively, to factor data type.

### Question 2

**Use the `outlierKD2()` function, remove the outliers for gre and gpa. Save the resulting dataframe as Adata2. You will need to do this in two steps, removing outliers for one variable at a time. How many NA values are in gre and in gpa with the resulting dataframe *Adata2*? **

```{r Q2}
summary(Adata)
Adata2<-outlierKD2(Adata, gre, rm=TRUE, boxplt=FALSE, histogram=FALSE)
Adata2<-outlierKD2(Adata, gpa, rm=TRUE, boxplt=FALSE, histogram=FALSE)
Adata2$admit<-as.factor(Adata2$admit)
Adata2$rank<-as.factor((Adata2$rank))
summary(Adata2)
```
After removing outliers from both GPA and GRE data there is one NA value in the GPA column and zero in the GRE column.

### Question 3

**Like last time, separate the two subsets again, for admitted and rejected. **
```{r Q3}
Accepted<-subset(Adata2, admit==1)
Rejected<-subset(Adata2, admit==0)
```

The data for accepted applicants is sorted into the Accepted data frame, while the data for the rejected applicants is sorted into the Rejected data frame.

### Question 4

**We were a little careless last time. Let us check for normality on the numerical variables. Let us use histogram (use `ggplot()`) and QQ-plot (use `qqnorm()`) to check the quantitative variables for the admitted and rejected subsets. Make a brief comment on the results. **

```{r Q4}
hist_gre_accepted<-ggplot(Accepted, aes(x=gre)) + 
  geom_histogram(fill='green', aes(y=..density..))+
  xlim(200,1000)+
  stat_function(fun = dnorm, args = list(mean = mean(Accepted$gre), sd = sd(Accepted$gre)), color='dark green', fill='green') +
  geom_area(stat="function", fun=dnorm, fill='green')
  labs(title="Histogram of GRE Scores of Accepted Applicants", x="GRE Score", y="Total") +
  theme(panel.background = element_blank(),
        panel.border=element_rect(color='black', fill=NA),
        axis.text = element_text(size=14),
        axis.title = element_text(size=14),
        plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
hist_gpa_accepted<-ggplot(Accepted, aes(x=gpa)) + geom_histogram()
hist_gre_rejected<-ggplot(Rejected, aes(x=gre)) + geom_histogram()
hist_gpa_rejected<-ggplot(Rejected, aes(x=gpa)) + geom_histogram()
hist_gre_accepted
hist_gpa_accepted
hist_gre_rejected
hist_gpa_rejected
```

### Question 5

**Does the two subgroups have different gre average and gpa average? Use the standard $\alpha$ = 0.05. What are the p-values for the test on gre and gpa? What are your conclusions from the tests? **

Answer answer answer. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet...



### Question 6

**With the dataset Adata2, construct a contingency table between rank and admit. Are these two variables qualitative or quantitative? **

Answer answer answer. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet...



### Question 7

**Find out whether rank is independent of admission, according to the contingency table above. **

Answer answer answer. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet...



### Question 8

**From *Adata2*, test whether students from the four ranks have the same average gre or not. And also test if they have the same average gpa or not. Remember that if they are not all the same, you will need to follow up with a post hoc test. Make brief comments on your results.**
